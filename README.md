# IATI Graph Database

Humanitarian organizations are coalescing around sharing information on aid activities, transactions and results via an open data sharing framework and XML standard called **IATI**.

The framework was created by the humanitarian community through the International Aid Transparency Initiative to make information more transparent and accessible to machine applications. This includes new artificial intellgent applications and today's popular digital assistants like **Alexa**, **Cortan**, **Siri** and next-generation state-of-the-art conversational chatbots like Google's **Meena** and Facebook's **Blender**.

In order to research how IATI data can power humanitarian AI applications, databases need to be setup and configured to support sophisticated testing and training activities. Humanitarian AI community members are working out how to store a live up-to-date clone of IATI's entire corpus in a graph database.
